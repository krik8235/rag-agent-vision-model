# Overview

An image-to-text agent using NLP and Llama 3.2 11B Vision Model.

The agent as an expert English teacher will analyze the image file, extract keywords, group them semantically, and craft concise sentences demonstrating correct usage.

1. Feed scanned textbook to the model:

2. Extract keywords

3. List up a few sample words on UI

## Key Features
Automate the contract review process through the following steps:

1. **Image Upload**:
   - Uploads an image (jpg/png) to the system.
   - Encode the image by paragraph.

2. **Retrieve Key Information**:
   - Employs Llama 3.2 11B Vision Model (running on Together AI) 
      - [Llama 3.2 Vision Capabilities](https://www.llama.com/docs/how-to-guides/vision-capabilities/)
   - Use NLTK to process the prompt
   - Extract paragraph, questions, and correct answers in string format from the encoded image in string.

3. **AI-Powered Vocabulary List**:
   -  Send the retrieved string data to the agent
   -  Genearate vocabulary list with meaning and a sample sentence.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Present the vocabulary list for the user (This repository contains a simple React app as an user interface.)

```

## Setup

1. Install the `pipenv` package manager:
   ```
   pip install pipenv
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pipenv shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt -v
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:
   ```
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
   ```

## Usage
1. Test the AI assistant:
   ```
   pipenv shell
   python main.py
   ```
   In the terminal, you can trace the process analyzing the sample textbook data.

2. Start the Flask backend:
   ```
   python -m flask run --debug
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.


3. In a separate terminal, run the React frontend app:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

   Call the Flask API from the frontend app to see the result on user interface.



## Development

### Package Management with pipenv

- Add a package: `pipenv install <package>`
- Remove a package: `pipenv uninstall <package>`
- Run a command in the virtual environment: `pipenv run <command>`

* After adding/removing the package, update `requirements.txt` accordingly or run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to reflect the changes in dependencies.

* To reinstall all the dependencies, delete `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`, then run:
   ```
   pipenv shell
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt -v
   ```


### Pre-commit Hooks

1. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```
   pipenv run pre-commit install
   ```

2. Run pre-commit checks manually:
   ```
   pipenv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

Pre-commit hooks help maintain code quality by running checks for formatting, linting, and other issues before each commit.

*To skip pre-commit hooks
   ```
   git commit --no-verify -m "your-commit-message"
   ```

### Customizing AI Agents

To modify or add new AI agents, edit the `agents.py` file. Each agent is defined with a specific role, goal, and set of tools.

To modify or add templated prompts, edit/add files to the `Prompts` folder.

* This project employs `Chain of thought technique` as well as `Role based prompting`.

### Modifying RAG Functionality

The system uses Chroma DB to store and query the images uploaded. To update the knowledge base:

1. Add new contract documents to the `uploads/` directory.
2. Modify the `agents.py` file to update the ingestion process if necessary.
3. Run the ingestion process to update the Chroma DB.


## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add your-amazing-feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature`)
5. Open a pull request



## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- API key errors: Ensure all API keys in the `.env` file are correct and up to date.
- Database connection issues: Check if the Chroma DB is properly initialized and accessible.
- Memory errors: If processing large contracts, you may need to increase the available memory for the Python process.
- Issues related to the AI agents or RAG system: Check the `output.log` file for detailed error messages and stack traces.
